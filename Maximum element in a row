Solution:

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int r,c,i,j,s=0;
    cin>>r>>c;
    int a[r][c];
    for(int i=0;i<r;i++)
    {
        for(int j=0;j<c;j++)
        {
            cin>>a[i][j];
        }
    }
    for(int i=0;i<r;i++)
    {
        for(int j=0;j<c;j++)
        {
           if(a[i][j]>s)
           {
               s=a[i][j];
           }
        }
        cout<<s<<endl;
        s=0;
    }
}
